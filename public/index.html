                            It was freezing cold one Sunday morning in Manali, Himachal Pradesh. Austin, Vibhakar and I 
                            decided to visit Vashisht Springs, but on our way back to the hotel, we saw this beautiful bridge 
                            that overlooked the Beas River.

                            A lovely July Sunday morning in Palo Alto, CA. I drove down to San Matteo with my cousins
                            to checkout Cars and Croissants: to see cool cars, and eat yummy croissants. I couldn't 
                            miss a photo with this beauty right here.

                            The Bay Area has a lot of beautifully decorated buildings, with unique color patterns
                            that are difficult to find in any other part of the world. This particular one was at San Matteo, 
                            which is famous for its Cars and Croissants exhibitions on sundays.

                        I was born with vertigo: but I pushed myself one fateful day and climbed up a narrow hill
                        on the edge of a cliff. The view on top was breathtaking. I struck a "Messi" with Big Sur 
                        in the background.

                        The Bay Area is paradise for fitness freaks, and Big Basin has a several long hikes.
                        This one was part of a 7 Mile hike, and I managed to use my iPhone to make the hike look
                        colorful, although it was not. Nonetheless, some of the views were special.

                        I saw Mark Zuckerburg pose just like this when he visited India. When I saw this array of columns,
                        I knew I was going to "follow in his footsteps". This is me imitating him, a far cry at best!

                        I visited Manali when I needed some answers in my life. When I visited the tibetan monasteries, 
                        I admired the focus and the grit that some of the monks had. I learned a lot about human will that trip,
                        and my friend Austin obliged when I asked him to make a memory of it.

                        the highest peak around was memorable. I used my quick wit and pulled out my camera: and the rest 
                        as they is history.
